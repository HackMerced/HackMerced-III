                  <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
                  <p>
                    A hackathon is best described as an ‚Äúinvention marathon‚Äù. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don‚Äôt have to be a programmer and you certainly don‚Äôt have to be majoring in Computer Science.

                  <h3>Where will the hackathon be located?</h3>
                  <p>
                   Like last year's hackathon, our venue will be held in UC Merced's COB1 and COB2 buildings. More details concerning workshop locations, bus pickups, and a more comprehensive overview
                   of our venue will be announced before the hackathon.

                  <h3>What if I don‚Äôt know how to code?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Don't worry, many of our previous years attendees are new or beginning to code! It‚Äôs entirely irrelevant what your experience is going into a hackathon, it‚Äôs more about your interest in technology. Our event has many workshops and mentors to help you get started on creating an app!

                  <h3>What if I don't have an idea?</h3>
                  <p>
                    That‚Äôs normal. Most people don‚Äôt have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. And there will be prizes at the event which might help give you some ideas. Don‚Äôt worry about it, you‚Äôll find something to work on.

                  <h3>Where can I sleep/shower?</h3>
                  <p>
                    We've set up a few spaces around campus for you to bring sleeping bags, comforters and other things to prep you for this event. If the floor doesn't suit your favor, HackMerced works with Airbnb to get you a discount on local housing. As for showering we have a few designated areas where you can clean yourself up at.

                  <p>
                    Yes, we will have you covered on eating for these 3 days, including breakfast lunch dinner and plenty of snacks!
