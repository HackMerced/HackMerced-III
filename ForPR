Hello, 

I'm Eve, a graduate student who majors in Applied Statistics. :)
Because I'm really interested in 2017 HackMerced and I hope to increase the possibility of being admitted, I sent a message asking how to do PR (honestly, I thought it mean "public relation" haha).
Fortunately, one of your members replied me and even sent me a tutorial teaching me how to PR. (Forgive me that even I do learn Python and R, I often use them to do the data analysis and seldom use Github >.<.)

So, here we go! ^___^

I hope this pull request will not disturb you guys' works. Look forward to my application result! Please feel free to contact me with my registered email address: yuanyichen@ucla.edu
Can't wait to stop by HackMerced!!!

Sincerely,
Eve
